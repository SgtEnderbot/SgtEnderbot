What's up? I'm SgtEnderbot!

I'm learning to code and 3D model. I am soon going to learn how to animate those 3D models.
I already enjoy 2D frame-by-frame animation, but my drawing tablet is borked so I can't draw on there right now.
I love creating stories and unique characters! Maybe some of those will appear here soon!
Thanks for checking out my repositories!



I use Arch, by the way. :)
